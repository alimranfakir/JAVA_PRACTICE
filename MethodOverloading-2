//if a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters, it is known as Method Overloading.
//In java, method overloading is not possible by changing the return type of the method only because of ambiguity
//why we use methodoverloading??-> if there is more then one method and they are working for same we can easily use same method to remember the name
//-> it improves code readability and re-usability 
//=> achieves consistency in naming 

public class MethodOverloading {
